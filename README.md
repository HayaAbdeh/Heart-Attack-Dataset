# Heart-Attack-Dataset
Heart Attack Analysis &amp; Prediction Dataset for second capstone project of edx


This is the second project for the Harvard Data Science Professional Program by Prof. of Biostatistics Rafael Irizarry from Harvard University. In this capstone project, we will choose our own data to make analysis and apply machine learning methods.

As we will choose our own Data set to analyze, we will make a study about the Heart Disease Data set, we will analyze it, visualize it, and apply machine learning methods to make prediction if an individual will have a heart disease or not.
The data set has been updated about four months ago, and published on kaggle site. the data set can be downloaded from this link https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset
or from this site

we will work with (heart.csv) file, we will explore the date set and all its variables and analyze the relationship between them and apply machine learning methods to make our predictions.
